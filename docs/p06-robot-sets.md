# Robot sets

Below is the list of sets that one could consider to use either as a base to build a vehicle for the Future Engineers competition or as a model to learn and practise skills to participate in the competition.

  * [SunFounder PiCar-V Kit V2](https://www.sunfounder.com/picar-v.html){target=_blank}. Pay attention to the fact that there are two DC motors driving the vehicle - this is not allowed by the competition rules.

  * LEGO Mindstorms EV3 and Raspbery Pi with a camera. One of the possible ways to [connect them is by BlueTooth](http://www.abrowndesign.com/2018/10/25/sending-bluetooth-messages-from-raspberry-pi-to-lego-ev3-stock-firmware/){target=_blank} but don't use this way for the competition.

  * [Fischertechnik Robotics Competition Set](https://www.fischertechnik.de/en/products/teaching/stem-robotics/519143-robotics-competition-set){target=_blank}. It could be hard to build a steering mechanism with this set. But the ROBOTCS TXT Controller supports [programming on Python](https://cfw.ftcommunity.de/ftcommunity-TXT/en/programming/python/tutorial-2.html){target=_blank}.

  * [MATRIX Mini Starter Robot Kit](https://matrixrobotics.com/product/matrix-mini-starter-robot-kit/){target=_blank} and [the Pixy2 camera](https://pixycam.com/pixy2/){target=_blank}.

  * LEGO Education SPIKE Prime with OpenMV camera. [Here](https://www.instructables.com/Backpack-1-OpenMV-Camera/){target=_blank} is instructions to connect these devices together . After that it will require to deploy a special library to the OpenMV camera -- see examples [here](https://github.com/ceeoinnovations/SPIKEPrimeBackpacks/tree/master/examples){target=_blank}.

  * [MakeBlock Ultimate 2.0 Kit](https://education.makeblock.com/ultimate-2/){target=_blank} and Raspberry Pi with a camera.

  * [CViC](http://makely.tech/cvic){target=_blank} - a set for participation in the autonomous cars competitions for school students.

  * [LEGO EV3 Computer Vision Add-on](http://ev3cv.robitware.ru/){target=_blank} - an extension kit allowing to connect RaspberryPI and EV3 by I2C.
