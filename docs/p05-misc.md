# Miscellaneous

This section contains the links to other useful materials that could help with the preparation to the competition (e.g. simulations, prototyping, tactics and strategy).

  * [The documentation](https://f1tenth.org/learn.html){target=_blank} for the course F1TENTH that teaches the foundations of autonomy by using self-driven cars.

  * A tutorial [how to build a self-driving RC car using Raspberry Pi and machine learning using Google Colab](https://techwithsach.com/build-a-self-driving-rc-car-using-raspberry-pi-and-machine-learning-using-google-colab/){target=_blank}

  * [The documentation](https://docs.donkeycar.com/){target=_blank} of the DonkeyCar project. It can be used to build a preliminary viewof  how a car for the competition could look. And [here](https://makezine.com/projects/build-autonomous-rc-car-raspberry-pi/){target=_blank} is a story, interesting from an engineering point of view, of how the first DonkeyCar appeared.

  * [The series of blogposts](https://becominghuman.ai/building-self-driving-rc-car-series-1-intro-equipments-plan-8d9f579df45c){target=_blank} to build and program a self-driving car.

  * [An article](https://medium.com/@florianherrengt/building-a-basic-self-driving-rc-car-bca6a7521753){target=_blank} explaining how to assemble a controller to autonomously control an RC car from a smartphone.

  * [The series of the tutorials](https://custom-build-robots.com/roboter/autonom-fahrendes-raspberry-pi-ki-roboter-auto-software/9777){target=_blank} in German on how to assemble a customized vehicle and use the DonkeyCar software to control it.

  * [Another article](https://www.hackster.io/SQLCodeMonkey/raspberry-pi-autonomous-rc-car-a666a4){target=_blank} covering how to transform a toy RC car to be autonomously controlled by the Raspberry Pi board.

  * [Detailed description](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetracer/blob/master/docs/latrax/hardware_setup.md){target=_blank} how to assemble a self-driven car from Traxxas LaTrax Rally 1/18 4WD and NVIDIA Jetson Nano. Someone could also find it useful to consider [a review of hardware costs](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetracer/blob/master/docs/latrax/bill_of_materials.md){target=_blank} required for this project in order to see which materials can be used in similar projects.

  * [A GitHub repo](https://github.com/multunus/autonomous-rc-car){target=_blank} providing materials to control an RC car autonomously by using Raspberry Pi and Neural Networks.
